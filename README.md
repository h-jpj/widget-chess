## üìñ Usage

### Starting a Game

When you first run the application, a new game will be created automatically. The board will appear on your screen with white to move.

### Making Moves

1. Click and drag a piece to move it
2. Legal moves will be highlighted
3. Release the mouse button to complete the move
4. The turn indicator will update to show the next player's turn

### Check and Checkmate

1. When a player is in check, the turn indicator will change to "CHECK! YOUR TURN" with an orange glow
2. Only legal moves that get the king out of check will be allowed
3. When a player is in checkmate, the game will end
4. The turn indicator will change to "CHECKMATE!" with a red glow
5. A reset button will appear below the board to reset all states (game, connection, and move history)

### Connecting to a Friend

1. One player needs to ensure their firewall allows incoming connections on port 5555 (default)
2. This player should share their IP address with the other player
3. The other player enters this IP address in the connection field and clicks "Connect"
4. Once connected, moves will be synchronized between both players
